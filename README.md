# Olfactory Intelligence
Olfactory Computational Neuroscience (Public Info)
In order to understand the true value of our sense of smell. We must first understand olfaction "how we smell" and aroma "what we smell", which both provide key scientific value. 

Olfaction: How we Smell
Olfaction starts when molecules, known as odorants, bind to receptors in our nose. This interaction sets off a chain of biochemical reactions that convert these chemical signals into electrical ones, which our brain then interprets. The complexity and variety of receptor types allow us to distinguish an almost limitless array of smells. This system not only detects odors but also plays a crucial role in our perception and emotional responses, thanks to its direct links to the brain's emotional centers. 

Aroma: What we Smell
When we breathe in, we take in a blend of molecules that are in the air around us. The chemicals that we perceive as scents come off of objects through a process known as volatilization. This involves the conversion of a substance from a liquid or solid state into a gas, enabling its molecules to disperse into the air. Each inhale acts like a live sampling of our environment, giving our brains a detailed chemical update on our surroundings. 

Olfactory Neuroscience: Interpretation of Electric Signals
The electric signal travels up the olfactory nerve to the olfactory bulb at the brain's base. This area acts as a sort of switchboard, directing the signals to various parts of the brain for higher cognitive and emotional processing. 

Amygdala: This region is crucial for the emotional tagging of smells.

Hippocampus: Here, the olfactory information is integrated with spatial memory and experience, contributing to detailed memory formation.

Prefrontal Cortex: This region assesses the pleasantness or threat level of an odor and can initiate appropriate behavioral responses.

Olfaction and Workplace Performance: The Link
Prefrontal Cortex (PFC): Activation of the PFC is often linked to performing tasks that require concentration and judgement-like cybersecurity or ethical AI. The PFC works in conjunction with the olfactory system to control responses to odors, particularly in social contexts where decision-making is influenced by smells.

Hippocampus: The hippocampus is involved when tasks require learning new information or recalling existing knowledge to solve problems-like being a team leader or innovator. The hippocampus helps encode memories based on olfactory cues, enhancing the recall of complex associations between smells and past experiences.

These pathways enable the olfactory system to have a profound impact on emotional regulation, memory formation, and decision-making processes, all integral to building satisfied, highly-effective workplaces. 

Olfactory Behavior: What can it tell us?
Neural homeostasis relates to how well the brain manages stress or relaxation, influenced by personal factors such as family life, romantic complications, chronic fatigue, etc. Olfactory cues can significantly affect this balance. 

Response Behavior: How a person reacts to certain scents can reveal key psychometrics that are hardwired into their brain. Memory Formation: Observing which scents evoke memories can provide insights into a person’s long-term memory functioning, emotional associations, and biases. Decision Making: Research suggests that individuals may make decisions based on smells, sometimes even unconsciously. Understanding how scent is encoded into this decision making, can provide a new layer of intelligence for HR Strategists. 

The Value for Both Employees and Employers 
With companies now boasting diverse, global teams, understanding and leveraging differences is key to optimizing workplace dynamics and reducing turnover. 

For example, reduced efficiency in meetings can occur when team members from different regions have varying levels of comfort with direct communication. Employing stimulating aromas in meeting rooms can help enhance cognitive clarity, aiding in better participation across cultural lines.

Leveraging tactical aroma in the workplace is a win-win for both employees and employers. By deriving insights from scent behavior, employers can better align their team-building, hiring, and retention strategies, creating an environment where employees are more likely to stay longer. This approach not only enhances job satisfaction and team cohesion but also supports the long-term financial growth of the company.
