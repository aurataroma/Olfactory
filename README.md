Olfactory Computational Neuroscience (Public Info)
The primary olfactory cortex interacts with a variety of cortical and limbic structures via sophisticated pathways that allow the smell to become integrated with memory, emotions, and taste. The human olfactory system is a complex and finely tuned network that translates chemical stimuli (odorants) into neural signals, ultimately resulting in the perception of smell.
